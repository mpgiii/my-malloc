No special instructions.

I was having a lot of trouble with the malloc, realloc repeated test failing
because data was getting corrupted. However, I figured out that when I was
searching for a node that would fit the size needed, I would ALWAYS split this
into two nodes, even if there wasn't enough space for a header and the minimum
allocated stuff above that node. This was causing slight leakage. Overall, I
am pretty proud of what I've written. Hopefully you enjoy reading comments, if
you do that!
