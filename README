No special instructions.

I believe my realloc works as intended, but it seems there is a bug where
even if the buffer would have fit, and no copying would need to be done, my
realloc will still do this. I thought I handled this and I cannot figure out
what is causing it after a lot of time looking at it, so I left it as-is.
