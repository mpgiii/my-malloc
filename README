No special instructions.

I know my realloc has some sort of bug where it's not correctly copying
contents according to your tests-- however, I have no idea how to fix this.
I have attempted to debug by writing long strings and realloc'ing them,
forcing the buffer to actually be copied over, and I couldn't reproduce
this issue, so I chose to leave it as is. Other than that, hopefully my
comments are easy enough to understand! :)
