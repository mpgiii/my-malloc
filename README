No special instructions.

The one big issue I am having is, believe it or not, with my Makefile. For
"make malloc", I have made its only dependency intel-all, and it runs no
command of its own. I tried to troubleshoot but it seems its trying to link,
claiming there is no reference to main. In any case, to build the static
libraries, simply call "make lib/libmalloc.a or "make lib64/libmalloc.a".
Based on my testing, running "make" still works perfectly but will spit out
that annoying error. other than that, nothing else special to note. :)
